### How to use

Install Raycast, clone the repo and then in Raycast use the `import extension` command to import the extension from your cloned folder.

Go to your cloned folder and run `npm install && npm run dev` then you should be able to use it!

Note: You should only need to run `npm run dev` once to build the executable. Once that's done it should work without having to run `npm run dev` again.
